# Lazy-Nezumi-Pro-Trial-Reset  
A simple bat file that resets Lazy Nezumi Pro's Trial.  
  
Newest version is not supported. Seems like the dev found this method to reset trial days :)  
  
Last Confirmed working is: **21.10.27.1642**  
~~This version can be found on [Archive.org][1]~~  ***Link was taken Down***  

Currently everything seems to be patched even cracks using winmm.dll won't work on the newest version. I will take a look at it again in a few months and if nothing has changed then this repository will be archived and the trial reset will be marked as deprecated.
